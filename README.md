# GasPricesbyCountry
For this project I did a analysis with R of the gas prices from 2000-2020. 

  - Countries included: USA, Canada, Mexico, England, France, Spain, India, Russia, China, and Japan

For this analysis I pulled historical data from 2000-2020 for each country. I cleaned the data to get the average gas price per year for each country and merged them into one spreadsheet using Excel. Once I was satified with the quality and setup of the data I started writing my code in R.
