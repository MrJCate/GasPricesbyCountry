  - Countries included: USA, China, Germany, Japan, India, United Kingdom, France, Brazil, Italy, and Canada

For this analysis, I gathered historical data from 2000 to 2020 for each country. I cleaned the data to obtain the average gas price per year for each country and merged everything into a single spreadsheet using Excel. Once I was satisfied with the data quality and organization, I began writing my code in R. In R, I rearranged the data to facilitate analysis and converted values from USD per liter to USD per gallon. Finally, I created line graphs to compare gas prices across different countries over the years.
