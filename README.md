For this analysis I pulled historical data from 2000-2020 for each country. I cleaned the data to get the average gas price per year for each country and merged them into one spreadsheet using Excel. Once I was satified with the quality and setup of the data I started writing my code in R. In R, I rearranged the data to be easier to work and convert values from USD per liter to USD per gallon. Lastly, I started to create line graph visuals to compare companies prices over the years.
