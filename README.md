For this analysis I pulled historical data from 2000-2020 for each country. I cleaned the data to get the average gas price per year for each country and merged them into one spreadsheet using Excel. Once I was satified with the quality and setup of the data I started writing my code in R. 

*Disclaimer - Data was obtained from AI and isnt verified as accurate. The goal of the project wasnt to anaylsis real, accurate data but was to showcase my data analyst skillset in R.
